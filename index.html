                Today I learned a few html functions to make a simple website. As well, I played Among Us while I was waiting for the class to start.

                This week in the class, I learned about all the different types of jobs available in the engineering field, such as software engineers, chemical engineers, or aerospace engineers. Then, we watched a complex video of a Ruth Goldberg machine which transported salt along an intricate circuit. After that, we actually tried to make a similar, but much more simplistic version of the machine in Tinker Cad. In order to better our skills with Tinker Cad, we modeled different household appliances, and I created a Samsung fridge which turned out pretty good even though I didn't win the competition.

                This week I continued working on my Rube Goldberg machine to pop a ballon, starting with a baseball. To accomplish the task, I used 3 simple machines, an incline plane, an axle, and a lever. My design was pretty barebones but could I think it could've popped the balloon if we built it in real life. Then, we went into groups to compare designs and form one machine combining components of each person's model.

                This week we actually started to build the Rube Goldberg machine with cardboard. My groupmates were pretty creative with their approaches and ways to make our physical machine. My job was to make all the boxes needed using nets of cubes and prisms. On Thursday, I made a floatation device made of paper to hold weight. My boat had 184 grams of weight on it, and floated for 3:34 seconds.

                This week, my group and I finished building the Rube Goldberg Machine after a long time working on it. Once we tested it, there were a few errors in our design, such as the distance between the ramp, falling box, and the lever being too far, which we worked out in order for it to work. After making sure everything was foolproof, we added in the needle and balloon. The baseball was pushed down the ramp and after a few seconds, the balloon was popped. All of us felt a amazing and that our hardwork and creativity paid off.

                This week, we started learning about a new field of engineering called computer engineering and all the different components of the field. To deepen out knowledge of how computers work and different elements that make them up, we took apart a large laptop. The amount of interconnected systems and modules was very fascinating and I was shocked at how they are made or even thought up. Afterwards, we noted on all the locations of things in the computer like the CPU, RAM, and battery before wrapping up the project by putting it all back together in reverse.

                This week, we focused on bioengineering, which combines engineering and biology to solve problems in the medical and research field. To better understand the field, we researched and designed a prosthetic limb for an animal in Tinkercad. My prosthetic was for the dosal fin of an orca, an extremely large animal I came to find out. It was pretty difficult to create a curved fin in Tinkercad, but eventually I was able to create an object looking similar to the real thing. In my design, the fake dorsal fin would slide and be connected to whatever is left of the fin. As well, the challenge for this week was to make instructions for cooking a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for someone else to follow. My instructions were not very detailed, so they most likely would not work correctly if this was an actual machine task.

                This week, we learned about aerospace engineering. A guest speaker came in on Zoom and taught us about what the field consists of and the opportunities within it. To apply our knowledge, we designed rockets starting from a single bottle in Tinkercad. My design was pretty simple and defiitely could have have been improved. I unfortunately missed out on the challenge for the week, but it from what I have heard, it seemed very fun.

                This week, we finished building and testing out rockets. My group's had two large wings with smaller bottles connected to the wings. The plan was the put fans on these bottles to make the rocket fly farther. However, the fans were way too heavy and thus hurt more than they helped. When it came time to test out our machine, it completely failed. The angle of launch was quite low, so when the rocket was released, it fell to the ground immediately. This was most likely because it was released from the pump too soon, and because it was too heavy. Because the launch was a disaster, we tried to see if our build worked at all, so we threw it off of the building. When we did so, the rocket fell to the ground rapidly and a wing fell off. Afterwards, we tested it with the pump again with only one wing this time, and it flew slightly farther but mostly just spun in the air.

                This week, we learned all about environmental engineering. To actually understand the field, the topic we dissected was water filtration and all of its parts. Water treatment plants are very complicated and require multiple stages with the water passing by each and getting cleaner at every level. Then we applied what we learned by making a mini-filtration system with sand, tissues, and two sizes of rocks. The layers of my group's device went as follows, from bottom to top, tissues, sand, small and big rocks, and then more tissues. Because of time, we were only able to run the water through once, but the result was still quite clear.
