                Today I learned a few html functions to make a simple website. As well, I played Among Us while I was waiting for the class to start.

                This week in the class, I learned about all the different types of jobs available in the engineering field, such as software engineers, chemical engineers, or aerospace engineers. Then, we watched a complex video of a Ruth Goldberg machine which transported salt along an intricate circuit. After that, we actually tried to make a similar, but much more simplistic version of the machine in Tinker Cad. In order to better our skills with Tinker Cad, we modeled different household appliances, and I created a Samsung fridge which turned out pretty good even though I didn't win the competition.

                This week I continued working on my Rube Goldberg machine to pop a ballon, starting with a baseball. To accomplish the task, I used 3 simple machines, an incline plane, an axle, and a lever. My design was pretty barebones but could I think it could've popped the balloon if we built it in real life. Then, we went into groups to compare designs and form one machine combining components of each person's model.

                This week we actually started to build the Rube Goldberg machine with cardboard. My groupmates were pretty creative with their approaches and ways to make our physical machine. My job was to make all the boxes needed using nets of cubes and prisms. On Thursday, I made a floatation device made of paper to hold weight. My boat had 184 grams of weight on it, and floated for 3:34 seconds.

                This week, my group and I finished building the Rube Goldberg Machine after a long time working on it. Once we tested it, there were a few errors in our design, such as the distance between the ramp, falling box, and the lever being too far, which we worked out in order for it to work. After making sure everything was foolproof, we added in the needle and balloon. The baseball was pushed down the ramp and after a few seconds, the balloon was popped. All of us felt a amazing and that our hardwork and creativity paid off.
