                Today I learned a few html functions to make a simple website. As well, I played Among Us while I was waiting for the class to start.

                This week in the class, I learned about all the different types of jobs available in the engineering field, such as software engineers, chemical engineers, or aerospace engineers. Then, we watched a complex video of a Ruth Goldberg machine which transported salt along an intricate circuit. After that, we actually tried to make a similar, but much more simplistic version of the machine in Tinker Cad. In order to better our skills with Tinker Cad, we modeled different household appliances, and I created a Samsung fridge which turned out pretty good even though I didn't win the competition.

                This week I continued working on my Rube Goldberg machine to pop a ballon, starting with a baseball. To accomplish the task, I used 3 simple machines, an incline plane, an axle, and a lever. My design was pretty barebones but could I think it couldve popped the balloon if we built it in real life. Then, we went into groups to compare designs and form one machine combining components of each person's model.
